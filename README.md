## oracle sql snippets
Oracle scripts and queries used in the life of a software tester

### tabdtl.sql
`tabdtl.sql` is used from an Oracle sql*plus session. The parameters are:

`@tabdtl.sql <db_owner> <table_name>`

Example: 

`@tabdtl.sql airp system_instance_parameter`

This script was copied from somewhere on the internet many years ago, possibly inspired by Informix DBINFO...
